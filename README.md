# Healthcare Facility Access in Kenya – County-Level Analysis

This project explores the distribution of healthcare facilities across Kenyan counties and compares it with county populations to reveal disparities in healthcare access.

## 📊 Tools Used
- Tableau (Visualization)
- Excel (Regression Analysis)
- Python (optional for data cleaning)

## 📈 Tableau Dashboard
Explore the interactive dashboard here:  
👉 [Healthcare Facility Access in Kenya – Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/HealthcareFacilityAccessinKenyaCountyLevelAnalysis/Sheet7)
## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for the regression analysis is available here:  
👉 [Kenya_Healthcare_Regression.xlsx](./Kenya_Healthcare_Regression.xlsx)

It contains county-level data on:
- Number of healthcare facilities
- Population
- Population per facility
- Other variables used for predictive modeling

This data supported both the Tableau visualizations and the regression analysis in the final report.


## 📄 PDF Report
The full project report with visual explanations and regression analysis is available [here](https://github.com/CollinsKRutto/healthcare-access-Kenya/blob/main/Analyzing%20Healthcare%20Access%20Inequality%20in%20Kenya.pdf)).

## 🔍 Key Findings
- Counties like Nairobi and Kiambu have high facility concentrations.
- Regression analysis shows a strong correlation between population and facility count (R² = 0.76).
- However, some counties still show healthcare access inequality.

## 💡 Next Steps
Future improvements may include:
- Adding geospatial clustering
- Integrating poverty and health outcome metrics
