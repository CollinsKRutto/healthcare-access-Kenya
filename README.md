The full project report with visual explanations and regression analysis is available [here](https://github.com/CollinsKRutto/healthcare-access-Kenya/blob/main/Analyzing%20Healthcare%20Access%20Inequality%20in%20Kenya.pdf)).

## 🔍 Key Findings
- Counties like Nairobi and Kiambu have high facility concentrations.
- Regression analysis shows a strong correlation between population and facility count (R² = 0.76).
- However, some counties still show healthcare access inequality.

## 💡 Next Steps
Future improvements may include:
- Adding geospatial clustering
- Integrating poverty and health outcome metrics
